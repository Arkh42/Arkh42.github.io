# circuit-invader

I need and enjoy drawing schematics of electronic circuits (transistor-level mainly).
To do so, I use the powerfull `circuitikz` package (information [there](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz)) which helps you to draw vectorized images directly included into your LaTeX code.

I will not lie by saying it is easy to use.
It is not hardcore, but it requires time to practice.
So I decided to provide the code for common schematics.
These lines of code can be directly included in LaTeX files or can be used as a start to create custom schematics.

# UMONS LaTeX

I am a big fan of LaTeX to write long documents such as reports, lectures or theses.
Even though I think everyone should you it for numerous reasons, I must admit that it is not easy for a beginner to start properly.

When I have specific needs, I write packages and classes to automate processes or to create dedicated commands.
One possible need is the creation of proper templates.
This is the case for my work at the University of Mons, where there was no official LaTeX template for PhD theses.
So I decided to create one.
