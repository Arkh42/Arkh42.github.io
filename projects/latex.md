# circuit-invader

I need and enjoy drawing schematics of electronic circuits (transistor-level mainly).
To do so, I use the powerfull `circuitikz` package (information [there](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz)) which helps you to draw vectorized images directly included into your LaTeX code.

I will not lie by saying it is easy to use.
It is not hardcore, but it requires time to practice.
So I decided to provide the code for common schematics.
These lines of code can be directly included in LaTeX files or can be used as a start to create custom schematics.
