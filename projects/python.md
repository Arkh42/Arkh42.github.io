# GreatPublicationPlanner

Plan the conferences that we want to attend to is not an easy exercise.
Firstly, you need to find the interesting one. It depends on your research.
Secondly, you need to check if the deadlines match your time.

To solve this, I created a tool which displays properly the data to help you to choose which conferences to target.
The user has to collect the information (e.g., submission, start and end dates) and gather it into a csv or Excel file. The rest of the job is made by the tool.
